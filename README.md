#  CFDPost_auto

- This program basically enables the user to apply a single ANSYS CFD Post state/session file on multiple result files in a location, one after the other.

- The user can change the scan locations and paths to ANSYS executables. The requirements to function are the path to the:-
		a. CFX result files, 
		b. post macro (.cst/.cse)
		c. ANSYS CFD Post executable 

- The code is split up into useful functions that can (hopefully) also be used as standalone programs, as per the need. This modularity and reusability should increase in the future.

- The documentation is on-going and not complete by any means. However, the program is commented out and doc strings and tests will be developed in the near future.
